WHAT YOU NEED:
- this program
- OBS (not Streamlabs)
- Rivals of Aether


INSTRUCTIONS FOR OBS:

1. In OBS, go to File -> Settings -> Output -> Replay Buffer and set Enable Replay Buffer. Set the Maximium Replay Time to 20 seconds.

2. Make a scene for your instant replay. Set up a Media Source. Have it point to roa_instant_replay.mp4 in the same directory as this program (roa_instant_replay.exe).

3. Hit Start Replay Buffer in the main OBS window.


INSTRUCTIONS FOR THIS PROGRAM:

1. Open roa_instant_replay.exe. Set the names of your main scene and instant replay scene.

2. If you do not run Rivals of Aether in full screen at 1080p, you'll need to manually set the size and location of your Rivals window. You can take a screenshot and use GIMP to find this information if needed.

3. Run the program. Everything should be automatic from here.

TROUBLESHOOTING:

If the application doesn't work for you, you may need to install the proper codecs. Install ffmpeg using this tutorial: https://www.wikihow.com/Install-FFmpeg-on-Windows
